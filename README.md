Assignment 1 – Divide and Conquer Algorithms
Learning Goals

Implement classic divide-and-conquer algorithms with safe recursion patterns.

Analyze running-time recurrences using Master Theorem and Akra–Bazzi intuition, and validate with measurements.

Collect metrics (execution time, recursion depth, comparisons/allocations).

Communicate results via report and maintain a clean Git history.

Implemented Algorithms
1.MergeSort (D&C, Master Case 2)

Uses a linear-time merge procedure.

Reuses a buffer to reduce allocations.

Switches to Insertion Sort for small subproblems (n < cutoff).

Recurrence:

𝑇
(
𝑛
)
=
2
𝑇
(
𝑛
/
2
)
+
Θ
(
𝑛
)
⇒
𝑇
(
𝑛
)
=
Θ
(
𝑛
log
⁡
𝑛
)
T(n)=2T(n/2)+Θ(n)⇒T(n)=Θ(nlogn)
2. QuickSort (Robust)

Randomized pivot selection for good expected balance.

Always recurses on the smaller partition, iterates over the larger one (to keep stack depth bounded).

Typical recursion depth ≈ O(log n).

Recurrence (expected case):

𝑇
(
𝑛
)
=
𝑇
(
𝑛
/
2
)
+
Θ
(
𝑛
)
⇒
Θ
(
𝑛
log
⁡
𝑛
)
T(n)=T(n/2)+Θ(n)⇒Θ(nlogn)
3. Deterministic Select (Median-of-Medians, O(n))

Groups elements in blocks of 5, finds median of medians.

Uses pivot for in-place partition.

Only recurses into the needed half.

Recurrence:

𝑇
(
𝑛
)
=
𝑇
(
𝑛
/
5
)
+
𝑇
(
7
𝑛
/
10
)
+
Θ
(
𝑛
)
⇒
Θ
(
𝑛
)
T(n)=T(n/5)+T(7n/10)+Θ(n)⇒Θ(n)
4. Closest Pair of Points (2D, O(n log n))

Sorts points by x-coordinate.

Recursive split by halves.

Checks the middle strip in O(n) time using y-sorting and scanning up to 7–8 neighbors.

Recurrence:

𝑇
(
𝑛
)
=
2
𝑇
(
𝑛
/
2
)
+
Θ
(
𝑛
)
⇒
Θ
(
𝑛
log
⁡
𝑛
)
T(n)=2T(n/2)+Θ(n)⇒Θ(nlogn)
Metrics

Execution Time (measured with System.nanoTime()).

Recursion Depth (tracked by a global counter).

Comparisons / Allocations (tracked via MetricsCollector).

CSV Export: results are written for plotting.

Results & Analysis

Time vs n: MergeSort and QuickSort scale as Θ(n log n), while Select is linear Θ(n).

Depth vs n: QuickSort depth remains bounded near 2*log₂(n).

Constant factors: Insertion sort cutoff improves MergeSort for small n; cache effects are visible at large n.

Summary

Theoretical predictions match measurements closely.

QuickSort with randomized pivot performs better in practice than MergeSort for many cases, though MergeSort guarantees worst-case Θ(n log n).

Deterministic Select is slower in practice than randomized QuickSelect but provides worst-case O(n) guarantee.

Closest Pair demonstrates the power of divide-and-conquer in geometry.
